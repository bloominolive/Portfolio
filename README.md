# Overview

For this web app, I wanted to get the foundation of a basic portfolio completed. I selected colors, fonts, and a layout I felt was a good representation of me and my work. I am working on improving my skills in React JS and Bootstrap, so this was a fun project to tackle from scratch to make something meaningful and useful. 

The site can be opened in local host and the Home page is what comes up when the program starts. There are links for a bio and work examples as well. I also wanted some way to contact me so there are a few ways to email me or find me on LinkedIn or GitHub.

# Web Pages
The first page is a Home page with a quick snippet about me and a Bootstrap carousel with some of my work examples. Each item in the carousel is linked to the site of work, or you can see more details on the Work page. 
The Work page has multiple screenshots for each work example with descriptions. Each is linked to it's appropriate webpage. I used multiple components to build this page like a WorkRow and WebsiteSection that take props and return the information with correct styling. 
The Bio page is all about who I am and why I am doing what I am. I have a short overview of the beginning of my journey, the middle, and plans for the future. 
Each page used React components in some way and was made to be responsive for different screen sizes.


# Development Environment

I used React Javascript and Bootstrap. I implemented Routing Navigation from React and react router. I used a Bootstrap carousel and set styling for the Bootstrap in the custom-bootstrap.scss file. I also used the FontAwesome library for some icons.

# Future Work

* I would like to make a proper contact page with a form
* I would like to have more work samples that are more recent or are other passion projects
* I would like to do more with cleaner animations or CSS styles that would make it look more professional.
